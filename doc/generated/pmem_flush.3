.SH NAME

\f[B]pmem_flush\f[](), \f[B]pmem_drain\f[](),
\f[B]pmem_has_hw_drain\f[]() \-\- check persistency, store persistent
data and delete mappings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmem.h>

void\ pmem_flush(const\ void\ *addr,\ size_t\ len);
void\ pmem_drain(void);
int\ pmem_has_hw_drain(void);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The functions in this section provide access to the stages of flushing
to persistence, for the less common cases where an application needs
more control of the flushing operations than the
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) function.
.PP
The \f[B]pmem_flush\f[]() and \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() functions provide
partial versions of the \f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) function.
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) can be thought of as this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
void
pmem_persist(const\ void\ *addr,\ size_t\ len)
{
\ \ \ \ /*\ flush\ the\ processor\ caches\ */
\ \ \ \ pmem_flush(addr,\ len);

\ \ \ \ /*\ wait\ for\ any\ pmem\ stores\ to\ drain\ from\ HW\ buffers\ */
\ \ \ \ pmem_drain();
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
These functions allow advanced programs to create their own variations
of \f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3).
For example, a program that needs to flush several discontiguous ranges
can call \f[B]pmem_flush\f[]() for each range and then follow up by
calling \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() once.
.PP
The \f[B]pmem_has_hw_drain\f[]() function checks if the machine supports
an explicit \f[I]hardware drain\f[] instruction for persistent memory.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem_flush\f[]() and \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() functions return no
value.
.PP
The \f[B]pmem_has_hw_drain\f[]() function returns true if the machine
supports an explicit \f[I]hardware drain\f[] instruction for persistent
memory.
On Intel processors with persistent memory, stores to persistent memory
are considered persistent once they are flushed from the CPU caches, so
this function always returns false.
Despite that, programs using \f[B]pmem_flush\f[]() to flush ranges of
memory should still follow up by calling \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]() once to
ensure the flushes are complete.
As mentioned above, \f[B]pmem_persist\f[](3) handles calling both
\f[B]pmem_flush\f[]() and \f[B]pmem_drain\f[]().
