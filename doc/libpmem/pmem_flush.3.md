# NAME #

**pmem_flush**(), **pmem_drain**(),
**pmem_has_hw_drain**() -- check persistency, store persistent
									data and delete mappings


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem.h>

void pmem_flush(const void *addr, size_t len);
void pmem_drain(void);
int pmem_has_hw_drain(void);
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The functions in this section provide access to the stages of flushing
to persistence, for the less common cases where an application needs more
control of the flushing operations than the **pmem_persist**(3) function.

The **pmem_flush**() and **pmem_drain**() functions provide
partial versions of the **pmem_persist**(3) function.
**pmem_persist**(3) can be thought of as this:

```c
void
pmem_persist(const void *addr, size_t len)
{
	/* flush the processor caches */
	pmem_flush(addr, len);

	/* wait for any pmem stores to drain from HW buffers */
	pmem_drain();
}
```

These functions allow advanced programs to create their own variations
of **pmem_persist**(3). For example, a program that needs to flush
several discontiguous ranges can call **pmem_flush**() for each range
and then follow up by calling **pmem_drain**() once.

The **pmem_has_hw_drain**() function checks if the machine
supports an explicit *hardware drain*
instruction for persistent memory.


# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmem_flush**() and **pmem_drain**() functions return no value.

The **pmem_has_hw_drain**() function returns true if the machine
supports an explicit *hardware drain*
instruction for persistent memory.
On Intel processors with persistent memory,
stores to persistent memory are considered persistent
once they are flushed from the CPU caches, so this
function always returns false. Despite that, programs using
**pmem_flush**() to flush ranges of memory should still follow up by calling
**pmem_drain**() once to ensure the flushes are complete. As mentioned above,
**pmem_persist**(3) handles calling both **pmem_flush**() and **pmem_drain**().
