### NAME

**pmempool-create** − Create Persistent Memory Pool of specified type

### SYNOPSIS

```
pmempool create [<options>] [<type>] [<bsize>] <file>
```

### DESCRIPTION

The **pmempool** invoked with **create** command creates a pool file of specified type. Depending on a pool type it is possible to provide more properties of pool.

Valid pool types are: **blk**, **log** and **obj** which stands for *pmem*blk*, pmem*log and *pmem*obj pools respectively. By default the pool file is created with *minimum* allowed size for specified pool type. The minimum sizes for **blk**, **log** and **obj** pool types are **PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL**, **PMEMLOG_MIN_POOL** and **PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL** respectively. See **libpmemblk**(3)**, libpmemlog**(3) and **libpmemobj**(3) for details.

For *pmemblk* pool type block size **\<bsize\>** is a required argument.

In order to set custom size of pool use **-s** option, or use **-M** option to create a pool of maximum available size on underlying file system.

The *size* argument may be passed in format that permits only the upper-case character for byte - B as specified in IEC 80000-13, IEEE 1541 and the Metric Interchange Format. Standards accept SI units with obligatory B - kB, MB, GB … which means multiplier by 1000 and IEC units with optional “iB” - KiB, MiB, GiB, …, K, M, G, … - which means multiplier by 1024.

**Available options:**

**-s, –size** \<size\>

: Size of pool file.

**-M, –max-size**

: Set size of pool to available space of underlying file system.

**-m, –mode** \<octal\>

: Set permissions to \<octal\> (the default is 0664).

**-i, –inherit** \<file\>

: Create a new pool of the same size and other properties as **\<file\>.**

**-v, –verbose**

: Increase verbosity level.

**-h, –help**

: Display help message and exit.


**Options for PMEMBLK:**

By default when creating a pmem **blk** pool, the **BTT** layout is *not* written until the first *write operation* of block entry is performed. Using **-w** option you can force writing **BTT** layout by writing zero data to specified block number. By default the *write operation* is performed to block number **0**. Please refer to **libpmemblk**(3) for details.

**-w, –write-layout**

: Force writing **BTT** layout by performing *write operation* to block number zero.

**Options for PMEMOBJ:**

: By default when creating a pmem **obj** pool, the layout name provided to the **libpmemobj** library is an empty string. Please refer to **libpmemobj**(3) for details.

**-l, –layout** \<layout\>

: Layout name of the **pmemobj** pool.


### EXAMPLES

*pmempool create blk 512 pool.blk*

: Create a blk pool file of minimum allowed size and block size 512 bytes

*pmempool create log -M pool.log*

: Create a log pool file of maximum allowed size

*pmempool create blk –size=4G –write-layout 1K pool.blk*

: Create a blk pool file of size 4G, block size 1K and write BTT layout using write operation to the block number 1

*pmempool create –layout my_layout obj pool.obj*

: Create an obj pool file of minimum allowed size and layout ’my_layout’

*pmempool create –inherit=pool.log new_pool.log*

: Create a pool file based on pool.log file
