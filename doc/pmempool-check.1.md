### NAME

**pmempool-check**  − Check and repair Persistent Memory Pool

### SYNOPSIS

```
pmempool check [<options>] <file>
```

### DESCRIPTION

The **pmempool** invoked with **check** command checks consistency of a given pool file. If the pool file is consistent **pmempool** exits with 0 value. If the pool file is not consistent non-zero error code is returned.

In case of any errors, the proper message is printed. The verbosity level may be increased using **-v** option. The output messages may be also suppressed using **-q** option.

It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using **-r** option. In order to be sure this will not corrupt your data you can either create backup of the pool file using **-b** option or just print what would be fixed without modifying original pool using **-N** option.


**Available options:**

**-r, –repair**

: Try to repair a pool file if possible.

**-y, –yes**

: Answer yes on all questions.

**-N, –no-exec**

: Don’t execute, just show what would be done.

**-b, –backup \<file\>**

: Create backup of a pool file before executing. Terminate if it is *not* possible to create a backup file. This option requires **-r** option.

**-q, –quiet**

: Be quiet and don’t print any messages.

**-v, –verbose**

: Be more verbose.

**-h, –help**

: Display help message and exit.
